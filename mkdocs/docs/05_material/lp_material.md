# Material

This is a list of materials I needed to build the box and cluster from scratch so this is just a rough approximation of what you would need if you want to re-build it at home depending of what you already own.

I already had some stuff at home but the box in total does house 20x RPIs.

The drill holes for the RPI mounts are 3mm and the lane holes are 10mm (I did have to buy respective drills).

|PSU for fans|1|CHF 98.90|[Galaxus](https://www.galaxus.ch/)|I bought a small one with 650W (still overkill, you can go lower or even find another solution)|

I also did buy some M6 screws with 8mm length, some washers with 1mm thickness for the M6 screws and some M6 nuts but I forgot where I bought them.

To connect the aluminium rails I did buy 90° connections but they are a real pain to work with. Try to go with [cubic connections](https://www.norelem.ch/de/Produkt%C3%BCbersicht/Montagesystem/10000/Verbinder-f%C3%BCr-Aluminiumprofile/W%C3%BCrfelverbinders%C3%A4tze-Typ-B/p/agid.17153) and figure it out (it will save you from going mad).

I did not have an electrical saw at hand so I did everything by hand with a pull-saw. I strongly recommend that you get yourself an electrical one if you can. Anything that is able to cut plexiglass is fine.
