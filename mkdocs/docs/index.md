# Homelab with RPI 5

This is a beginners guide to create a homelab using Raspberry Pi 5 SBC's to run a stable Kubernetes cluster with Ceph storage.

**Everything will be publicly usable for everyone.**

Since the topic of Kubernetes kind of exploded since 2016 I wanted to provide a general base of knowledge and support to handle bare-metal installations.

This homelab and its ideas can be extended to a full production-grade setup and I will mention the missing parts that we do not need in a homelab environment.

I decided to use RPI's because they are very quiet, do not need much power and still can carry basic applications.

All installation routines will be done with [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) but there are still some manual tasks to perform.


Thanks to the software and infrastructure people:

- [The Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/)
- [The Ansible Community](https://docs.ansible.com/)
- [The Kubernetes Community](https://kubernetes.io/)

Thanks to the shops that everything was in stock:

- [ThePiShop](https://www.pi-shop.ch/) (RPIs & PoE HATs)
- [ThePiHut](https://thepihut.com/) (Heatsinks)
- [Motedis](https://www.motedis.ch/en) (precise cut aluminium rails)
- [BÃ¶rlin AG (acrylglas24.ch)](https://acrylglas24.ch/) (precise cut plexiglass sheets)
- [Galaxus](https://www.galaxus.ch/) (all of the rest)

I listed most of it in the [material page](05_material/lp_material.md) (if things are missing you will figure it out). The result is all of the RPIs packed in a [box](06_thebox/lp_thebox.md).

#### General idea

- Bootstrapping the RPI's to handle them from a central workstation
    - Shameless plug for [Tuxedo](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/de) laptops :)
- Bootstrapping Kubernetes with [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
- Installing HA VPN nodes for public internet access of your cluster services
- Bootstrapping a Ceph cluster to use with Kubernetes for storage
- Deploying several services using Helm (inkl. setup)
- Using and structuring Ansible Playbooks to handle everything in a declarative manner
- Explanations of why and how I decided to do things the way I did

#### The result (in this example)

- A [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster with
    - 3x [master nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components)
    - 10x [worker nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#node-components)
    - Ingress Controllers [(NGINX)](https://nginx.org/en/)
        - 2x dedicated ingress nodes
        - a self-signed PKI for general TLS handling
    - [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)
    - [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/)
    - [MKDocs (Material)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
    - *more to come ...*
- A [Ceph cluster](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/) with 5x nodes
    - 10x OSDs with 20TB raw storage for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using the [CSI-driver](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi)
    - 3x [monitor nodes](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/man/8/ceph-mon/)
    - 2x [manager nodes](https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/mgr/index.html)
    - 1x [CephFS](https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/cephfs/index.html) for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
    - WebUI inkl. self-signed certificates
- An HA entrypoint for external and local traffic
    - VPN setup with [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)
    - [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) setup
    - [KeepaliveD](https://keepalived.org/) setup for vIP switching via VRRP
